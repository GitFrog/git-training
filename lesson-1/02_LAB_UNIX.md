1. Navigate to your C:/ drive on your computer using bash

3. Create a folder named "Animals"
4. Navigate into the folder and create two sub-directories: "Vertebrates", "Invertebrates". 
5. Move into the "Vertebrates" folder, and create two new sub-folders: Warm-blooded", "Cold-blooded".
5. Navigate into the "Warm-blooded" folder and create two files within it called "Mammals", and "Birds". Bonus points if you can create the two files in one line.
