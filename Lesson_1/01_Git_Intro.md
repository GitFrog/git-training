# Lesson 1: Git Basics

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand the use-case for version control, and git
2. Distinguish between git and hosting services such as github or Azure DevOps
3. Setup git and the requisite proxy settings on your workstation

## Why version-control?

Version control (or source-control) is the practise of tracking changes to files/code over time. There are many benefits to version-control:
+ The ability to roll-back changes if errors are found 
+ Revisit earlier versions of files
+ Distinguish between experimental code and code that has been released/is in production
+ <mark>TODO: [add a few more]</mark>


Ideally, we want to don't want to find ourselves in these kind of situations, **especially with code**:

## What is Git?

[In their own words](https://git-scm.com/):
> ![The git logo](assets/01_git_logo.png =75x)<br> Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Git is one of many version control softwares, but is one of the [most popular](https://rhodecode.com/insights/version-control-systems-2016#:~:text=To%20sum%20this%20up%3A,Mozilla%2C%20Nginx%2C%20and%20NetBeans.).

But really, Git helps us to:
1. Track changes across multiple files
2. Develop simulataneously multiple versions of a project
3. Explore the state of a project at some arbitrary point in the past
4. Collaborate with others on the same codebase
5. Provides tools to integrate changes (in a somewhat) systematic way
